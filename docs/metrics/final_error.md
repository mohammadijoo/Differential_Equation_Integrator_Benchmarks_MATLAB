# `final_error`

## Meaning

`final_error` measures the numerical error at the final reported time of a benchmark run.

## Mathematical definition

Let the numerical solution be $y_N$ at final time $t_N$, and let the exact or high-accuracy reference solution be $y_{\mathrm{ref}}(t_N)$. The metric is

$$
\texttt{final\_error}=\left\lVert y_N-y_{\mathrm{ref}}(t_N)\right\rVert_2.
$$

For scalar problems, this reduces to the absolute final-time error.

## Interpretation

A smaller value means that the method lands closer to the reference solution at the final time. This is useful for accuracy testing, convergence studies, and work-precision diagrams.

## Limitations

Final-time error can hide large transient errors, phase drift, energy drift, or qualitative trajectory failure before the final time. It should be interpreted together with `max_error`, `rmse_error`, and invariant or qualitative diagnostics.
